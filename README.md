- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielharrington06
- 👀 I’m interested in making programs that challenge the way I think. I have enjoyed programming games like Hangman, Connect 4 and TicTacToe with a focus on developing a Computer player. I use my knowledge from my A-Level Maths, Further Maths and Computing courses regularly to think through and develop solutions for problems. I want to make a GUI in more of my programs, so I decided to learn C# to make games in Unity.
- 🌱 I’m most familiar with Python and C#, although I have tried a bit of HTML.
- ⌚ My current project is my A-Level Computer Science Coursework, where I'm programming a Navigation App for my school using C#, Unity Dijkstra's and MySQL.
- 🥇 One of my greatest achievements was producing a program of my own design and development that converted joystick positions from a controller to motor velocities to be used in a VEX Robotics robot. I won the 'Best Engineer' award for this work.
