- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danielharrington06
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making programs that challenge the way I think. I have enjoyed programming games like Hangman, Connect 4 and TicTacToe with a focus on developing a Computer player. I want to include a GUI in more of my programs, so I decided to learn C# to make games in Unity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m most familiar with Python and C#, although I have tried a bit of HTML. Over the next 3 years, I will learn many new languages including C, Java and Haskell.
- âŒš My most recent project is my A-Level Computer Science Coursework, where I programmed a Navigation App for my school using C#, Unity, Dijkstra's and MySQL.
- ðŸ¥‡ One of my greatest achievements was producing a program of my own design and development that converted joystick positions from a controller to motor velocities to be used in a VEX Robotics robot. I won the 'Best Engineer' award for this work.
