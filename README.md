- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danielharrington06
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making programs that challenge me to think about the task. I enjoy programming games like Hangman, Connect 4 and TicTacToe with a focus on developing a Computer player. I use my knowledge from my A-Level Maths, Further Maths and Computing Courses regularly to think through and develop solutions for problems. I want to make a GUI in more of my programs, so I have decided to learn C#.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and further advancing my Python skills. I am most familiar with Python, although I have dabbled in HTML and C++.
- ðŸ¥‡ One of my greatest achievements was producing a program of my own design and development that converted joystick positions from a controller to motor velocities to be used in a VEX Robotics robot. I won the 'Best Engineer' award for this work.
