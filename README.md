# Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Harrington  
### BSc Computer Science Student | University College London (UCL)

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer with a strong interest in algorithms, embedded systems, and AI.

## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ **Undergraduate Student at UCL**, currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science
- ðŸ’» Experienced with **Python**, **C#** and **C**, and actively expanding my knowledge on **C**, **Haskell** and **Python**
- ðŸ§© Iâ€™m passionate about **embedded systems**, **AI** and **real-world applications of computing** that improve lives
- ðŸš§ I'm currently working on **a C program that simulates a robot searching for markers in a 2D arena** and **a Tetris AI**

During my studies and personal work, Iâ€™ve worked on several projects, including:
- A [**school navigation system**](https://github.com/danielharrington06/Stanborough-Navigation-App) built in Unity using **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** and **MySQL** that has numerous inclusivity-focused features such as step-free pathfinding and an intuitive UI
- A **joystick-to-motor translator** for a VEX robotics system, recognised with a *Best Engineer* award
- A **NEAT** neural network for flappy bird
- A [**Raspberry Pi Pico project**](https://github.com/danielharrington06/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-UART), transmitting ADC data via UART and displaying it graphically on an oscilloscope-style sliding window display to get to grips with how embedded systems are used in MedTech

## Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, C#, C, C++, (soon to learn Haskell and Java)
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Unity, MySQL, VEXCode, Matplotlib, Git, VS Code
