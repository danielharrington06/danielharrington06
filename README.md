# Hi, I’m Daniel Harrington  
### BSc Computer Science Student | University College London (UCL)

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m an aspiring software engineer with a strong interest in algorithms, embedded systems, and AI.

## About Me

- **Undergraduate Student at UCL**, currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science
- Experienced with **Python**, **C#** and **C**, and actively expanding my knowledge on **Java** and **Python**
- I’m passionate about **embedded systems**, **AI** and **real-world applications of computing** that improve lives
- I'm currently working on **learning Java** and **developing my knowledge of algorithms**

During my studies and personal work, I’ve worked on several projects, including:
- A [**school navigation system**](https://github.com/danielharrington06/Stanborough-Navigation-App) built in Unity using **Dijkstra’s algorithm** and **MySQL** that has numerous inclusivity-focused features such as step-free pathfinding and an intuitive UI
- A [**Spiral Search Robot Simulation**](https://github.com/danielharrington06/Spiral-Search-Robot-Sim) that simulated a robot searching for markers on a grid without knowledge of their exact location, instead employing my own *Spiral Algorithm*
- A [**Tetris AI**](https://github.com/danielharrington06/Tetris-AI) that played a modified version of Tetris with bombs, discards and exponential rewards for line clears
- A **joystick-to-motor translator** for a VEX robotics system, recognised with a *Best Engineer* award and playing a key role in winning the competition
- A [**Raspberry Pi Pico project**](https://github.com/danielharrington06/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-UART), transmitting ADC data via UART and displaying it graphically on an oscilloscope-style sliding window display to understand how embedded systems are used in medical embedded systems

## Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, C#, C, C++, Java, Haskell
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Git, VS Code, MySQL, Unity, VEXCode, Matplotlib
